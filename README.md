I'm confused about our different challenges - I'm not sure if this site is supposed to be different than the blog challenges I see that are later on. Consequentially, I'm going to make this site be the landing page for a blog, and later on I'll use the blog challenges to build out the blog "section" of this site.

#MVP

A static landing page for a website for "all thing's Tim."
