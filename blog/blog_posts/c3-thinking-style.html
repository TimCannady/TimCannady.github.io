        <p class="blogtitle">Thinking & Learning style - Fixed vs Growth mindset</p>
        <p class="blogpost">
          <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm"><span class="italics">“Not only do we have our preferred learning and working styles, we also have our favorite thinking styles. Professor Anthony Gregorc, professor of curriculum and instruction at the University of Connecticut, has divided these into four groups.”</a></span></p>
        <p class="blogpost">
          The four groups and my results:
        </p>

       <p class="blogpost"><ul class="ul">
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Concrete Sequential: </span>40</li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Abstract Random: </span>32</li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Concrete Random: </span>24</li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Abstract Sequential: </span>24</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p class="blogpost"><span class="italics">“Concrete Sequential thinkers tend to be based in reality. They process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way.”</span>
        </p>

        <p class="blogpost"> During our next argument I’m excited to let my fiance know that I’m the one who’s 'based in reality'. Just kidding though, we don’t really argue.
        </p>

         <p class="blogpost">
          Actually, sometimes we do. And perhaps it’s because I process information in an ordered, sequential way! I can be somewhat robotic when it comes to approaching things. While this might help when learning Ruby, it can be a double-edged sword when it comes to interpersonal skills. Humans are complex creatures. Sometimes it helps to approach things in an orderly fashion, for example when crafting the wedding budget. But other times, people just might want to vent, for example. When I’m trying to learn why my fiance had a bad day, I need to keep in mind that I might not always understand it, and sometimes my way of offering support shouldn’t be in an ordered, sequential manner. Just a pair of open ears and asking “if there’s anything I can do to help” would usually suffice. Hopefully I can take advantage of this understanding during DBC. It's a beautiful thing that we all process (and teach) information differently. The better I understand my own methods, the better I can teach, and the better I can prep myself to receive. 
        </p>
        <p class="blogpost">
          On the topic of learning styles, there’s also a school of thought that outlines two different "mindsets" when it comes to learning: <span class="italics">fixed</span> versus  <span class="italics">growth:</span>

        <p class="blogpost"><ul class="ul">
        <li class="li"><span class="bold">Fixed mindset: </span>one’s ability is innate. Consequentially, someone with a fixed mindset is prone to proving he or she is better than someone else. This mindset is also prone to taking less risks because they’re a chance to have one’s ability disproven. Dislikes feedback.</li>
        <li class="li"><span class="bold">Growth mindset: </span>ability can be developed. Consequentially, someone with a growth mindset focuses on the process rather than the outcome. He or she is more likely to look to continually improve themselves because of their non-deterministic outlook. This type of mindset tends to be better at relationships because it doesn’t look at others as competition. Values feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p class="blogpost">
          I'd say this has been the biggest stuggle for me. How to get out of the idea that I might not be "good enough", like being good or not good is somehow a binary status. I've been combatting this by setting a goal of simply always getting better. For example, that quick 30 minutes of reading at lunch? I learned something new. That blog post from earlier? That's one more than yesterday. I learned something, I troubleshot, I got something done. Now I learn from it, reflect, put it behind me and make room for what's next. This mindset has relieved a lot of pressure while simultaneously putting wind in my sails. Afterall, I do enjoy coding! But sometimes we can be our own worst enemy, so consider doing some of the lessons. They can be pretty helpful when it comes to being more diplomatic with yourself when the times get tough!
