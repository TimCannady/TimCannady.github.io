        <p class="blogtitle">Values and combatting stereotype threat</p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        Some argue the best way to combat <a href="blog_posts/c6-stereotype-threat.html">'stereotype threat'</a> is by affirming the values that are important to us. Here's a look at some that are important to me and some ways I can apply them:
        </p>

        <p class="blogpost"><ul class="ul">
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Affection, Adventure, Challenge</span>  </li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Close Relationships, Community, Courage</span>  </li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Economic security, Environmentalism, Fairness</span>  </li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Friendships, Honesty, Inner harmony </span>  </li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Integrity, Introspection, Knowledge </span>  </li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Leadership, Meaningful work, Music</span>  </li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Nature, Personal development, Reputation </span>  </li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Romance, Security, Self-reliance, </span>  </li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Spirituality,  Wisdom</span>  </li>
        </ul></p>

         <p class="blogpost">
        After reading list, I think it's safe to say one of my values is to have a lot of values...
        </p>

        <p class="blogpost">
        It's hard to choose which are the most important. On a scale from one-to-five, I'd say I try to live up to most of these values by at least a three. The fives would probably be affection, adventure, close relationships, integrity, personal development and security.
        </p>

        <p class="blogpost">
        Integrity is a big one. <span class="italics">"Character is defined when no one is looking,"</span> and, <span class="italics">"you make the bed you sleep in"</span> are two quotes I keep in mind. To me, integrity means doing what's right because it's what's right. It's being a stand-up person, especially when faced with either adversity or with the chance to otherwise self-gain.
        </p>

         <p class="blogpost">
        The last topic someone asked for my advice on is too sensitive for a blog post. However it was a deeply important decision in someone's life, and one that will likely affect them for many years.  I was asked what I thought about the situation - what I might do. I told them, but I also stepped back and realized it wasn't so cut-and-dry. Rather, it was one of those decisions that needed to be decided by them. Not pragmatically, but quasi-spiritually. The repercussions from the decision were such that they would have to live with the outcome, not me. Advice was positioned clearly as my own, and I also side-stepped the offer and reminded them that the decision was theirs to make.
        </p>

        <p class="blogpost">
        When I think of my own values the result is that I feel good inside: a sense of calmness. Less in a proud-way, and more in a way that cuts through any lingering fog that might be causing some cognitive dissonance. Just this simple practice of writing them down could be a great way to mitigate stereotype threat which can be fog in its own right. 
        </p>

        <p class="blogpost">
        To combat the threat I think one of the biggest steps is to first be able to recognize it. It can creep up slowly, so addressing it early on is important. Next, I think simply reminding oneself of their values is a clever start. Cut through the noise, remind yourself of where you're from and where you're going. Stereotypes are rarely founded in values. And while they carry a heavy weight, such threats should inevitably dwindle in the face of deep-rooted personal values.
