          <p class="blogtitle">Dealing With Conflict</p>
          <p class="blogpost"> 
            Interpersonal conflict is a part of life. I don't think that makes it acceptable, but I think it's something to at least come to terms with as early as possible. That way we can embrace it, recognize it and know how to navigate it with tact.
          </p>   

          <p class="blogpost"> 
            I get pretty disheveled when things "aren't right," so I generally try to avoid conflicts. I'd rather take some preemptive steps to keep things sailing smoothly instead of frequently cleaning up messes. That said, it's simply not always avoidable. And I think that's an important fact to keep in mind. Being able to accept that things might now always be "right" is a skill in itself. I wish I affected by bumps in the road. Not that they should be ignored. Rather, to be able to get back instead of immediately having to find resolve.
          </p> 

          <p class="blogpost"> 
            Here's an example of when some conflict I've experienced:
          </p> 

          <p class="blogpost"> 
            In a previous job there was someone who I felt always took things wrong. Somehow my words were adjusted to include a belittling tone that I never meant to send. My personal reaction to this typically ranges with my mood. If I'm feeling empathetic or patient, I can be a little more open to understanding why. If I'm tired or have a shorter temper I might default to defensiveness, or worse, a counter-attack. None of these feelings are fun to have. I'd prefer never entering the pit, but again, it's not always avoidable. 
          </p> 

                    <p><img class="blogimg" src="../../imgs/defense.jpeg"></p> 

          <p class="blogpost"> 
            When it comes to conflict resolution I think a good starting point is to recognize that it takes two to tango. The other person didn't become upset out of nowhere; I took part in it. So it's now on me to resolve it, even if I didn't instigate. Here's where I like to begin:
          </p> 


          <p class="blogpost">
            <ul class="ul">
             <li class="li"><span class="bold">My feelings are important:</span> I felt frustrated when my words were taken in a way I didn't mean</li>
             <li class="li"><span class="bold">Their feelings are important:</span> they felt belittled by my words</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p class="blogpost"> 
            I think it's important to start by recognizing both sides of the coin. I can be quick to be defensive, so if I never consider the other person's feelings I'd always be on the defensive; <span class="italics">"why were they bending my words? What did I do to deserve this? I'm a nice guy and I meant no harm. Why am I under attack?"</span> 
          </p> 

          <p class="blogpost"> 
            It's much easier to get a clear picture when I also consider the other side of the coin: <span class="italics">"They aren't feeling this way for no reason. SOMETHING is going on. And I played a part, even if it was innocent. So why do they feel attacked? Was it the way I said something? Was it my body language? Is there something else going on that I don't know about, and my comment hit a pain point?"</span> It's only when you can recognize that both parties deserve equal attention that conflict resolution can begin.
          </p> 

          <p class="blogpost"> 
            If I could go back to any of these encounters, I'd add more patience and less defensiveness. I think too often I put the spotlight just on myself. I knew I meant well, so I wanted to defend it. But if I took myself off the pedestal I would have noticed someone who was truly hurt. Whether they were over-sensitive or not isn't something for me to decide. They're an adult and are entitled to feel how they want to. So I wish I had been even more patient and, in turn, more interested in trying to understand why these conflicts happened. 
          </p> 

          <p class="blogpost"> 
            Like debugging a program, interpersonal conflict can't be brute-forced. We must step back and understand that we might have the best of intent, but if the messages aren't getting through, we must develop the skill to understand why.
          </p>
