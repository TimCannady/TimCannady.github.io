        <p class="blogtitle">The Technological Land Grab</p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        Websites have become surprisingly easy to build. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage">The majority of humans are now online,</a> and they can be reached with decreasing effort. Bootstrapping is sexy, funding is plenty and mobile boomed. Consequentially it's easier than ever to start a web-based company, and one of the side-effects appears to be a technological land grab.
        </p>
         <p class="blogpost">
         I suppose there's nothing inherently wrong with a land grab - the idea that saying "I own a startup" is as generic as saying "I like steak." I'm all for the spirit of change, entrepreneurship, disruption and progress. But I can't help but feel a respectable portion of the boom is fueled by companies land grabbing for land grabbing-sake. Technological posers, of sort. And I don't really have any issues with posers either. It just seems that some of these companies could benefit from a look back at fundamental business practices.
        </p>

         <p class="blogpost">
        So what's a "bonifide startup"? A company with a website? With an app? A <span class="italics">responsive</span> website? Founded by Stanford grads? Funded by Sand Hill? Funded by grandma? Built in San Francisco? I don't have the answers. But I think a start would be to have a sound, old-fashioned business plan. One that sizes a market, describes the (realistic) opportunity, analyzes the competition and all those other things taught in business school (that educational system that pre-dated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOCs</a>). 
        </p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        I used to work for Trulia, a real estate startup. At one time Trulia was the disruptor. During my tenure it grew about 10x (200 - 1,500 employees), quadrupled its UV's (~14m - ~60m), went public on the NYSE and was finally purchased by sworn enemy Zillow. I'm not sure if or when Trulia was no longer a startup. But if so, perhaps it was around the time when other disruptors entered the space. Some were successful and some fizzled out. The ones that succeeded typically had a business plan, among other things like smart founders, a great product and solid sales team. But the ones that fizzled out typically had something in common: they seemed to all be pet-projects of sorts. Again, nothing wrong with a pet project.
        </p> 
        <p class="blogpost">
        The observations at Trulia are just one example. The technological landgrab is prevalent: <a href="https://youtu.be/qYZF6oIZtfc">Will.i.am is a coder</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/69V__a49xtw"> HBO has the hit series Silicon Valley</a>, "serial entrepreneur" is the new "CEO", <a href="http://tiffzhang.com/startup/?s=814644359517">and satirical websites like this almost seem real</a>.

        Pops said an observation without a fix is just a complaint, so here's some ideas. Do as you wish with your time and money (and try to do good by other people's time and money, too). But if you want to start a business, then start a business. I'd argue that a website isn't a business. Spending time on something doesn't make it a business. Sizing a market and saying "all we need is 3% to get rich" isn't a sound business plan. And save the C-level titles for companies with board members. 
        </p>
         <p class="blogpost">
         Want to make a business that's going to change the world? Or at least grab a significant portion of the market? Kudos to you, that's awesome. I think the best first step would be to Google <span class="italics">"how to build a business,"</span> instead of <span class="italics">"how to build a website."</span> The prior is the end, and the latter is simply a means!
