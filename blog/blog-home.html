        <p class="blogtitle">Understanding Classes</p>
        </a>
        <p class="blogpost">
        <span class="italics">"Classes are super powerful, and I love them."</span>
        </p>
         <p class="blogpost">
        That should be how you feel when someone mentions classes in Ruby - that they're super powerful, and you love them!  
        </p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        Humans like things to make sense, and we go to some pretty big lengths to make sure they do! We explore, poke and prod. We create languages so we can make sense of our findings, and we create names so we can tell things apart. For example, humans and dog are both "things". They're both living things, and they're both mammals. And both like being pet. 
        </p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        Like comparing and contrasting two mammals, classes in Ruby allow us to create objects that come pre-packged with specific traits, including those they inherit - similar to how a dog and human inherit traits from the mammal 'class'. Let's take a closer look by creating a class together.
        </p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        Let's say we run a website that specializes in music downloads. We'll need a way to categorize and organize the tunes. Classes to the rescue! We could create a generic object for each song, but guess what? Object.new is just creating a new object of the class <span class="italics">Class </span>. There's nothing generic about music, so let's learn how we can create a class called "Track". That way, we can call .new on it and have each song come pre-packaged with track-like attributes.
        </p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        Here we define a class called Track. Our new class is empty, so let's give it a method called 'title' that takes no arguments and simply returns "I'm empty." After that we create a new instance of a track and name it 'new_track'. Then we call our new method on our new track. <span class="italics">From our new Track class!</span>
        </p>
        <p><img class="blogimg" src="../imgs/class1.png"></p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        Here we give the class a method called 'initialize'. Initialize is a special method and is used when we want each instance of our class to be "initialized" with certain attributes upon creation. All songs need a title, so lets be sure every instance of Track is initialized with one. We asign 'title' equal to a funny looking variable called @title. Recall local variables disappear as soon as their method completes. We wouldn't want that to happen to our title attribute, so we use something called instance variable - all of which begin with the "@" symbol. That way it can be accessed from anywhere in the program - and at any time. Next, we define a method called 'info'. This will eventually output the track's info. We finish up by passing in a track name, "Song1", and then calling the info method on our new track:
        </p>
        <p><img class="blogimg" src="../imgs/class2.png"></p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        A song should have more info than a title. We first expand the 'initialize' method to accept more arguments. Then we create individual methods so the user can read each attribute. We finish by creating a new track, passing in some info and then calling one of our methods on our new track:
        </p>
        <p><img class="blogimg" src="../imgs/class3.png"></p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        That's all said and good, but it's a lot of work to make the user manually access each attribute. Let's add a method called 'info' that reads all the attributes in one go:
        </p>
        <p><img class="blogimg" src="../imgs/class4.png"></p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        You might be intimidated by how quickly our class has grown. And all just to store a few attributes. Fear not, Ruby to the rescue. If you notice your class methods are doing one thing, it's likely that they're either "reading" or "writing". For example, our artist method simply "reads" its value to the user. In cases like these we can tidy things up by using 'attr_reader' and 'attr_writer'. Notice the single-task methods have been absorbed into the 'attr_reader' section at the top. The functionality is the same: 
        </p>
        <p><img class="blogimg" src="../imgs/class5.png"></p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        Ruby also rescues us from our single-use "write" statements. In this example we didn't create any methods to write with, but note at the bottom where we try to update the 'artist' variable from "Artist1" to "Artist2" and the error it returns. This is because we haven't taught our Track class how to accept this kind of update. Remember: a computer program does exactly what you teach it - and no more!
        </p>
        <p><img class="blogimg" src="../imgs/class6.png"></p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        We address this by adding 'attr_reader' to the top. Alas, our attempt to "write" works. Ruby also offers another tool called 'attr_accessor'. Use this as a shortcut for attributes that you'll allow to be both reading and writing. I specifically use the term "allow" because the accessor tool might seem convenient, but it can cause headache - and even abuse - if not used sparingly:
        </p>
        <p><img class="blogimg" src="../imgs/class7.png"></p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        With that we've learned how to: 
        </p>
        <p class="blogpost"><ul class="ul">
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Define a new class</span></li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Initialize each instance with attributes</span></li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Define instance variables</span></li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Define methods inside classes</span></li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Create attribute readers, writers and accessors</span></li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Create an instance of a custom object</span></li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Call custom methods on it </span></li>
        </ul></p>
         <p class="blogpost">
        This is just a basic overview of classes, akin to a song's title being a mere glance at the song itself. One major topic we didn't cover includes "inheritance", for example how our track might inherit from a parent class called 'Music', along with its methods to <span class="italics">start/pause/stop</span>. Another topic is how classes can share and communicate their attributes with one-another. Finally, and one of the most important, is how to "mixin Enumerable", which is how we can teach our classes to be enumerable. See my post <a href="https://timcannady.github.io/blog/blog_posts/t4-enumerable-methods.html">here</a> for a little more info on enumeration.
        </p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        I hope this has been a helpful glimpse at the power of classes. For extra reading I recommended Chapter Three of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Well-Grounded-Rubyist-David-Black/dp/1933988657">The Well-Grounded Rubyist.</a>

        <p class="blogtitle">The Technological Land Grab</p>
        </a>
        <p class="blogpost">
        Websites have become surprisingly easy to build. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage">The majority of humans are now online,</a> and they can be reached with decreasing effort. Bootstrapping is sexy, funding is plenty and mobile boomed. Consequentially it's easier than ever to start a web-based company, and one of the side-effects appears to be a technological land grab.
        </p>
         <p class="blogpost">
         I suppose there's nothing inherently wrong with a land grab - the idea that saying "I own a startup" is as generic as saying "I like steak." I'm all for the spirit of change, entrepreneurship, disruption and progress. But I can't help but feel a respectable portion of the boom is fueled by companies land grabbing for land grabbing-sake. Technological posers, of sort. And I don't really have any issues with posers either. It just seems that some of these companies could benefit from a look back at fundamental business practices.
        </p>
        <img class="blogimg" src="../imgs/serial.png">
         <p class="blogpost">
        So what's a "bonafied startup"? A company with a website? With an app? A <span class="italics">responsive</span> website? Founded by Stanford grads? Funded by Sand Hill? Funded by grandma? Built in San Francisco? I don't have the answers. But I think a start would be to have a sound, old-fashioned business plan. One that sizes a market, describes the (realistic) opportunity, analyzes the competition and all those other things taught in business school (that educational system that pre-dated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOCs</a>). 
        </p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        I used to work for Trulia, a real estate startup. At one time Trulia was the disruptor. During my tenure it grew about 10x (200 - 1,500 employees), quadrupled its UV's (~14m - ~60m), went public on the NYSE and was finally purchased by sworn enemy Zillow. I'm not sure if or when Trulia was no longer a startup. But if so, perhaps it was around the time when other disruptors entered the space. Some were successful and some fizzled out. The ones that succeeded typically had a business plan, among other things like smart founders, a great product and solid sales team. But the ones that fizzled out typically had something in common: they seemed to all be pet-projects of sorts. Again, nothing wrong with a pet project.
        </p> 
        <p class="blogpost">
        The observations at Trulia are just one example. The technological landgrab is prevalent: <a href="https://youtu.be/qYZF6oIZtfc">Will.i.am is a coder</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/69V__a49xtw"> HBO has the hit series Silicon Valley</a>, "serial entrepreneur" is the new "CEO", <a href="http://tiffzhang.com/startup/?s=814644359517">and satirical websites like this almost seem real</a>. 
        </p>
        <img class="blogimg" src="../imgs/william.jpg">
        <p class="blogpost">
        Pops said an observation without a fix is just a complaint, so here's some ideas. Do as you wish with your time and money (and try to do good by other people's time and money, too). But if you want to start a business, then start a business. I'd argue that a website isn't a business. Spending time on something doesn't make it a business. Sizing a market and saying "all we need is 3% to get rich" isn't a sound business plan. And save the C-level titles for companies with board members. 
        </p>
         <p class="blogpost">
         Want to make a business that's going to change the world? Or at least grab a significant portion of the market? Kudos to you, that's awesome. I think the best first step would be to Google <span class="italics">"how to build a business,"</span> instead of <span class="italics">"how to build a website."</span> The prior is the end, and the latter is simply a means!

        fun with enumerator methods: <span class = "italics"> cycle - group_by - map</span></a> </p>
        <p class="blogpost">
         Let's take a peek at three enumerator methods. But first, a quick refresh of enumerators in general:
        </p>
         <p class="blogpost">
         <span class = "italics"> <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Enumerator.html">"An enumerator is a class which allows both internal and external iteration."</a></span> 
        </p>
         <p class="blogpost">
         In other words, a class is considered "to be an enumerator" if it has a specific set of methods that allow for iteration. We're familiar with casses like Array and String being enuerable, but this is because they come bundled with built-in enumerable methods. Which methods, you ask? Mainly the ones that allow iteration. The most popular (as well as mandatory) is <span class = "italics">.each</span>. 
        </p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        So enumerators are classes that can be iterated. Whether or not they can be iterated is up to the methods they contain. Popular classes come with them built in, but you can also make custom classes that are enumerable by adding  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7220634/how-do-i-use-the-enumerable-mixin-in-my-class"><span class = "italics">include Enumerable</span></a> during their initial definition. Now lets learn about some of the popular enumerable methods:
        </p>
        <p class="blogpost"><ul class="ul">
          <li class="li"><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Enumerable.html#method-i-cycle"><span class="bold">.cycle</span></a> <p>cycle cycles through your elements. Simple! For example, call cycle on an array, pass it a block to do something to each element of that array. It will do this. Forever. (remember to pass it an argument if you want it to just cycle n-times)</p>
          <p><img class="blogimg" src="../imgs/cycle.png"></p>
           </li>
           <li class="li"><a href ="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Enumerable.html#method-i-group_by"><span class="bold">.group_by</span></a> <p>group_by groups your elements by whatever code you pass the block. Furthermore, it returns a hash. Stay with me here. </p>
            <p class="blogpost">
           Another way of thinking of it is that group_by creates a hash and says, "any time there's a unique output from the block, we'll save it to a new key. For every element that resulted in that unique output, we'll assign it to that key's value in an array form. This way you can group all the elements together that would have the same output when passed to the block"</p>
            <p class="blogpost">
           So the hash's <span class="italics">keys</span> come from the evaluated result passed to the block on each iteration. For example, if the block multiplys an input by three, the first key would become the output, and the next key would become the value from the next iteration. On the other hand, the hash's <span class="italics">values</span> are simply the value of the element that was used by the block. In other words, it's the value of each index being passed ot the block. Consequentially, the hash's value can have more than one value (in array-form), one for each value that results in the same output when passed to the block.</p>
           <p>In the code below we call group_by on the range of numbers from one to six. Look to the block 
           and we'll notice that for every index (every number in the range), we simply multiply it by three. We've done this plenty of times with .each. But the difference is the way the output is saved. In the case of group_by, the output is saved in a hash. We see the <span class="italics">keys</span> become the values the block evaluated to (3,6,9 etc). The <span class="italics">values</span> are each element that resulted in the value that we just assigned to the keys. For example, the first pair has a value of one. When we multiply the value of the first index by three, the output is three. So the key becomes three, and the value is 1 (the value that was passed ot the block):</p>
          <p><img class="blogimg" src="../imgs/group_by.png"></p>
          </li>
           <li class="li"><a href ="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Enumerable.html#method-i-map"><span class="bold">.map</span></a> <p>map is a little easier to understand than group_by. The quickest way to understand map is to liken it to each. Recall that each does something to each element of the object it's called on, and it returns a new object. In other words, each isn't destructive. Map does just this but is destructive.  </p>
          <p><img class="blogimg" src="../imgs/map.png"></p>
           </li>
           <p class="blogpost">
          There's plenty of other enumerator methods to do all the tricks you need. Be sure to check out <a href ="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/">the Ruby Docs</a> for more!

        </a></p>
        <p class="blogpost">
          <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm"><span class="italics">“Not only do we have our preferred learning and working styles, we also have our favorite thinking styles. Professor Anthony Gregorc, professor of curriculum and instruction at the University of Connecticut, has divided these into four groups.”</a></span></p>
        <p class="blogpost">
          The four groups and my results:
        </p>
        <p class="blogpost"><ul class="ul">
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Concrete Sequential: </span>40</li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Abstract Random: </span>32</li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Concrete Random: </span>24</li>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Abstract Sequential: </span>24</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p class="blogpost"><span class="italics">“Concrete Sequential thinkers tend to be based in reality. They process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way.”</span>
        </p>
        <p class="blogpost"> During our next argument I’m excited to let my fiance know that I’m the one who’s 'based in reality'. Just kidding though, we don’t really argue.
        </p>
         <p class="blogpost">
          Actually, sometimes we do. And perhaps it’s because I process information in an ordered, sequential way! I can be somewhat robotic when it comes to approaching things. While this might help when learning Ruby, it can be a double-edged sword when it comes to interpersonal skills. Humans are complex creatures. Sometimes it helps to approach things in an orderly fashion, for example when crafting the wedding budget. But other times, people just might want to vent, for example. When I’m trying to learn why my fiance had a bad day, I need to keep in mind that I might not always understand it, and sometimes my way of offering support shouldn’t be in an ordered, sequential manner. Just a pair of open ears and asking “if there’s anything I can do to help” would usually suffice. Hopefully I can take advantage of this understanding during DBC. It's a beautiful thing that we all process (and teach) information differently. The better I understand my own methods, the better I can teach, and the better I can prep myself to receive. 
        </p>
        <p class="blogpost">
          On the topic of learning styles, there’s also a school of thought that outlines two different "mindsets" when it comes to learning: <span class="italics">fixed</span> versus  <span class="italics">growth:</span>
        <p class="blogpost"><ul class="ul">
        <li class="li"><span class="bold">Fixed mindset: </span>one’s ability is innate. Consequentially, someone with a fixed mindset is prone to proving he or she is better than someone else. This mindset is also prone to taking less risks because they’re a chance to have one’s ability disproven. Dislikes feedback.</li>
        <li class="li"><span class="bold">Growth mindset: </span>ability can be developed. Consequentially, someone with a growth mindset focuses on the process rather than the outcome. He or she is more likely to look to continually improve themselves because of their non-deterministic outlook. This type of mindset tends to be better at relationships because it doesn’t look at others as competition. Values feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        </p> 
        <p class="blogpost">
          I'd say this has been the biggest stuggle for me. How to get out of the idea that I might not be "good enough", like being good or not good is somehow a binary status. I've been combatting this by setting a goal of simply always getting better. For example, that quick 30 minutes of reading at lunch? I learned something new. That blog post from earlier? That's one more than yesterday. I learned something, I troubleshot, I got something done. Now I learn from it, reflect, put it behind me and make room for what's next. This mindset has relieved a lot of pressure while simultaneously putting wind in my sails. Afterall, I do enjoy coding! But sometimes we can be our own worst enemy, so consider doing some of the lessons. They can be pretty helpful when it comes to being more diplomatic with yourself when the times get tough!

        Collections and Container Objects: Arrays and Hashes

          This is where arrays and hashes come into play. "What about strings", you ask? Keep in mind strings are a single object. Each character in a string isn't its own object, as a test to .object_id will show. So it's best to look at strings as single objects, and itstead consider our <span class="italics">arrays</span> and <span class="italics">hashes</span> as the way to contain multiple objects.
        </p>
        <p class="blogpost">
          Let's take things a little further by looking at the latter. They're similar in that they both contain data. However arrays do this in an 'organized' fashion, where hashes are unordered. Why do we need this? Because sometimes we like things to be orderly, and sometimes we benefit from the casualness of an unordered collection. For example, every Sunday (before Game of Thrones) I put my daily vitamins in respective slots of a pill box. This is an ordered collection, much like an array. Even moreso because it's laid out in a linear fashion Monday-Friday (more about his later). However when when 11:30am rolls around and I have my mid-morning snack of almonds and cashews, I like them to be mixed. I want them to be in a collection like a bowl (or a hash. The digital kind, not breakfast). But I prefer an unorganized mix.

       <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Array: </span>arrays are organized groups of data laid out in a linear fashion. The first slot is for the first object, and the next slot is for the next. Want to know which object is in the first slot? Easy, just ask and it will tell you! Just about anything can be stored in a slot - even other arrays! Having trouble imagining this? Just imagine a train pulling a bunch of carts. That's an array. Drop a few carts into one of the carts and you've got an array within an array (also known as a '3d' array).
          </li>
        </p>
          <img class="blogimg" src="../imgs/pillbox.jpg"/>
          <li class="li"><span class="bold">Hashes: </span>hashes are frequently called 'key-value pairs of data.' A key is a like the word "name" and the value is like the name "Tim." Or "dog: Fido." Like arrays, hashes help us by holding a bunch of objects. However they do it in an unorganized manner, like our mixed nut example. Sometimes we just want to store a bunch of data an an unorganized box. For example, if you made an object for each student in the class, there's no real immediate to organize them. At least from the start. Perhaps an alphabetical sort would be beneficial later on, but there's methods for that. Since students needn't be organized inherently, the way you access them is simply by asking for the specific object. Want to query Tim? Just ask the hash about him!

        </ul>
          <img class="blogimg" src="../imgs/nuts.jpeg"/>
        <p class="blogpost">
         The main takeaway is that arrays and hashes are containers for collections of objects. However they store data differently (organized/unorganized), and consequentially, their data is accessed differently. For arrays you simply use index notation [0-n], and in hashes you can simply ask the object (that is, assuming you know it exists. If you don't, you can ask the hash describe its contents). Furthermore, both have unique looping and iteration techniques when it comes to accessing data from multiple indexes (arrays) or key-value pairs (hashes).

        </p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        Positioning things on a webpage is a little tricker than it looks. Chances are you've seen thousands of websites during your tenure as a professional internet surfer, and it's easy to forget the work that's taken place to grant you those experiences.</p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        Take buildings, for example. Each day we see structures that took thousands of man-hours to complete. Land was purchased, permits obtained, land bulldozed and foundations poured. Architects designed the structure, and contractors built the framework before laying the wiring and painting the walls. Websites are created in a similar fashion, albeit with a digital medium. Similar to building a website, we've seen so many buildings that we might simply think, "that wall looks easy to move."</p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        An HTML element is like a building's wall (or staircase, or any other physical feature), and moving them around isn't as simple as the drag of a mouse. One must understand how the element fits with the overall structure. Enter 'element positioning'. Sure, you can move it around like you can push a staircase around (stay with me here). But the element's borders are going to push things around, and a staircase is going to be difficult to scale if ends facing a wall.</p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        Let's take a peek at some positioning basics for elements:</p>
        <p class="blogpost"><ul class="ul">
        <li class="li"><span class="bold">Static:</span> all elements are Static by default. This means they'll be positioned "wherever they should be when it comes to the normal document flow." Explaining the workings of the document flow is best saved for a discussion on what's called the "Box Model." Just know that the browser interprets the document top-to-bottom placing each element where it "should go" based on where the other elements are (EG: don't overlap). Also, you can't move an element around (EG left, right, top, bottom) if it has Static positioning. You must change the value first.</li>
        <li class="li"><span class="bold">Absolute:</span> setting a position to Absolute can cause some confusion, but just know these two things: 1) An Absolute element defaults to the upper-left hand corner of the first parent element that has a positioning value of anything other than Static. Yes, a lot of words, but it's pretty simple. If you put a box with Absolute positioning within a series of other boxes-in-boxes, the Absolute box will align to the first box that has non-Static (non-default) positioning. Easy! 2) Setting positioning to Absolute removes the element from the normal document flow. Thus it can now overlap other elements, which can be good or bad depending on your goal. If you want your element to remain within the box it's currently in, you must set a width and heigh of the container or risk having the Absolute element overrun the borders. It's like the drawer I have for all my t-shirts. The drawer is way too small for all my shirts. If I set my drawer to Relative and my bundle of shirts to Absolute, the shirts would magically spill through the drawer's wall if I didn't also set the drawer's length and height to accommodate the larger bundle. </li>
        <li class="li"><span class="bold">Relative:</span> here's a tip when thinking about Relative positioning: imagine you have a box. If you set the box's position to Relative, it puts it exactly where it should be (a'la Static positioning). BUT, you can then shift the element Relative to where it would normally land. Repeat: 'relative to where IT should be. It's almost like youre looking at a box and shifting a ghost of itself in one direction, but the original box remains behind. The reason we look at it like this is because of the implications how it has on the normal document flow and any other objects around it. I'm still not exactly clear on how it affects them, but just keep this in mind. For example, if you have a container div that won't collapse to fit the size of the text within, it might be because of this. I'll check back when I learn more!</li>

          <ul><li> What are the benefits of version control?</ul>
              Imagine working in a Word document. When you're ready to store changes you click "Save" (Git calls this "commit"). But what happens if you want to return to a prior savepoint? This feature is  typically unavailable for consumer programs, and this is where version control shines. When you're ready to "save" a file in Git, you "commit" the changes. It's akin to saving multiple copies of the same file at each milestone. Furthermore, Git's version control tracks helpful info like what changes were made and memos from the change'ee.
          <p>
          <ul><li>How does git help you keep track of changes?</ul>
               Life isn't a video game (so it seems). Consequentially we benefit from ways to cover our tracks should we fall into the proverbial crocodile-pit (for example a faulty line of code). Keeping track of changes is a way to create save points. Furthermore, this makes things easier for us to collaborate with others, and that means more changes to create awesome code! By tracking changes, new collaborators also get a better understanding of the history of our code, what each version does, etc,

              <ul><li>Why use GitHub to store your code?</ul>
              GitHub's value is expansive. It's a place to store and track code. It's a place to show of and find other people's code. It's a place to get help and help other people's code. Furthermore, GitHub's format is conducive for companies with multiple people working on the same data set. And all of this is done in an approachable GUI format. It's a valuable resource whether you're a hobbyist working on your first "Hello World", or a team of a hundred developers working on a website.

        <p>
          Today we watched <span class="link"><a href = https://vimeo.com/85001014> a fireside chat recording with Shereef - DBC founder</a></span>. As always, Shefeef's enthusiasm for building a strong, healthy and passionate coding environment is infectious. He describes the fist cohort, being a marauding group of youthful coders rallied via Hacker News. Something he recognized was their ability to work as a team. Something in the office is broken? Take the lead and fix it. People are hungry? Order food. It was a group of do'ers, and do they did. Shereef goes on to describe how important this mentality is with DBC and with learning any new skill. Treat DBC as if you're a cook in a kitchen, as if you're one of many on a soccer team. If something needs to get done, do it. If someone is struggling, help them. If you aren't understanding something, go out there and try to undestand it. Don't look at your education as something you purchase. It's not a package, it's not a service. It's an interactive experience, and your role isn't to just watch. Showing up doesn't mean showing up physically. It means showing up emotionally, intelligently, empathetically.
        </p>
        <p>
            So far my take on the DBC expericence is better than I expected. Well, I suppose it's been all I was hoping for, and that's something I don't take for granted. The curriculum isn't too easy, and it isn't too hard. I trust I'll eat my words in a few weeks and consider these early weeks to have been cakewalk. But the introduction has been a nice pace. I can tell a lot of work went into our syllabus. I like the repetion, the immersion, the teaching-by-doing. In the past I've tried to learn CLI and Git. I'm finding that it's finally just now sticking, and that's exciting. 
        </p>
        <p>
           I'm also really enjoying how active my 'cohorts' have been on Google+. People don't seem to be afraid to reach out and to help out. I've felt comfortable seeking help as well. A few times I began asking something that was stumping me, but I decided to try just one more time before "bugging" other people's inboxes. I know I shouldn't look at it like that. And I don't really. But I think it's encouraging to know people are there to help, but in the end, this is my education, my playground. I need to struggle, to know when to keep looking, and to know when to ask for help. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My end-of-week reflection is that I'm liking how things are going. I think I fall in the "imposter" category and need to keep that in mind. That said, I'm finding myself stepping up to the plate. And what's exciting to me is that I'm finding myself overcoming little bugs, issues, mis-steps. Instead of moving on and skipping over something if it's not working or doesn't make sense, I'm finding myself really curious to fix it/understand it before moving on. That said, I need to be cognisant of the time. I hear it's only going to get more rigorous going forward. I'd like to be done with my work by Friday evening, saving bonus work for the weekend. This means time management, and this means mind-management. I'm working on getting into my zone quicker. On the flip side, I'm working on being ok with working out of my zone. That say I can take advantage of the quick 30-minute window before dinner is ready, for example.
