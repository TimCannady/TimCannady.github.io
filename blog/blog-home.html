          <ul><li> What are the benefits of version control?</ul>
              Imagine working in a Word document. When you're ready to store changes you click "Save" (Git calls this "commit"). But what happens if you want to return to a prior savepoint? This feature is  typically unavailable for consumer programs, and this is where version control shines. When you're ready to "save" a file in Git, you "commit" the changes. It's akin to saving multiple copies of the same file at each milestone. Furthermore, Git's version control tracks helpful info like what changes were made and memos from the change'ee.
          <p>
          <ul><li>How does git help you keep track of changes?</ul>
               Life isn't a video game (so it seems). Consequentially we benefit from ways to cover our tracks should we fall into the proverbial crocodile-pit (for example a faulty line of code). Keeping track of changes is a way to create save points. Furthermore, this makes things easier for us to collaborate with others, and that means more changes to create awesome code! By tracking changes, new collaborators also get a better understanding of the history of our code, what each version does, etc,

          <p>
              <ul><li>Why use GitHub to store your code?</ul>
              GitHub's value is expansive. It's a place to store and track code. It's a place to show of and find other people's code. It's a place to get help and help other people's code. Furthermore, GitHub's format is conducive for companies with multiple people working on the same data set. And all of this is done in an approachable GUI format. It's a valuable resource whether you're a hobbyist working on your first "Hello World", or a team of a hundred developers working on a website.

        <p>
          Today we watched <a href = https://vimeo.com/85001014> a fireside chat recording with Shereef - DBC founder</a>. As always, Shefeef's enthusiasm for building a strong, healthy and passionate coding environment is infectious. He describes the fist cohort, being a marauding group of youthful coders rallied via Hacker News. Something he recognized was their ability to work as a team. Something in the office is broken? Take the lead and fix it. People are hungry? Order food. It was a group of do'ers, and do they did. Shereef goes on to describe how important this mentality is with DBC and with learning any new skill. Treat DBC as if you're a cook in a kitchen, as if you're one of many on a soccer team. If something needs to get done, do it. If someone is struggling, help them. If you aren't understanding something, go out there and try to undestand it. Don't look at your education as something you purchase. It's not a package, it's not a service. It's an interactive experience, and your role isn't to just watch. Showing up doesn't mean showing up physically. It means showing up emotionally, intelligently, empathetically.
        </p>
        <p>
            So far my take on the DBC expericence is better than I expected. Well, I suppose it's been all I was hoping for, and that's something I don't take for granted. The curriculum isn't too easy, and it isn't too hard. I trust I'll eat my words in a few weeks and consider these early weeks to have been cakewalk. But the introduction has been a nice pace. I can tell a lot of work went into our syllabus. I like the repetion, the immersion, the teaching-by-doing. In the past I've tried to learn CLI and Git. I'm finding that it's finally just now sticking, and that's exciting. 
        </p>
        <p>
           I'm also really enjoying how active my 'cohorts' have been on Google+. People don't seem to be afraid to reach out and to help out. I've felt comfortable seeking help as well. A few times I began asking something that was stumping me, but I decided to try just one more time before "bugging" other people's inboxes. I know I shouldn't look at it like that. And I don't really. But I think it's encouraging to know people are there to help, but in the end, this is my education, my playground. I need to struggle, to know when to keep looking, and to know when to ask for help. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My end-of-week reflection is that I'm liking how things are going. I think I fall in the "imposter" category and need to keep that in mind. That said, I'm finding myself stepping up to the plate. And what's exciting to me is that I'm finding myself overcoming little bugs, issues, mis-steps. Instead of moving on and skipping over something if it's not working or doesn't make sense, I'm finding myself really curious to fix it/understand it before moving on. That said, I need to be cognisant of the time. I hear it's only going to get more rigorous going forward. I'd like to be done with my work by Friday evening, saving bonus work for the weekend. This means time management, and this means mind-management. I'm working on getting into my zone quicker. On the flip side, I'm working on being ok with working out of my zone. That say I can take advantage of the quick 30-minute window before dinner is ready, for example.
