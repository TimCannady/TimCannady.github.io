        T2 Git Blog: CSS Positioning - Static, Absolute, Relative
        </p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        Positioning things on a webpage is a little tricker than it looks. Chances are you've seen thousands of websites during your tenure as a professional internet surfer, and it's easy to forget the work that's taken place to grant you those experiences.</p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        Take buildings, for example. Each day we see structures that took thousands of man-hours to complete. Land was purchased, permits obtained, land bulldozed and foundations poured. Architects designed the structure, and contractors built the framework before laying the wiring and painting the walls. Websites are created in a similar fashion, albeit with a digital medium. Similar to building a website, we've seen so many buildings that we might simply think, "that wall looks easy to move."</p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        An HTML element is like a building's wall (or staircase, or any other physical feature), and moving them around isn't as simple as the drag of a mouse. One must understand how the element fits with the overall structure. Enter 'element positioning'. Sure, you can move it around like you can push a staircase around (stay with me here). But the element's borders are going to push things around, and a staircase is going to be difficult to scale if ends facing a wall.</p>
        <p class="blogpost">
        Let's take a peek at some positioning basics for elements:</p>
        <p class="blogpost"><ul class="ul">
        <li class="li"><span class="bold">Static:</span> all elements are Static by default. This means they'll be positioned "wherever they should be when it comes to the normal document flow." Explaining the workings of the document flow is best saved for a discussion on what's called the "Box Model." Just know that the browser interprets the document top-to-bottom placing each element where it "should go" based on where the other elements are (EG: don't overlap). Also, you can't move an element around (EG left, right, top, bottom) if it has Static positioning. You must change the value first.</li>
        <li class="li"><span class="bold">Relative:</span> setting a position to Absolute can cause some confusion, but just know these two things: 1) An Absolute element defaults to the upper-left hand corner of the first parent element that has a positioning value of anything other than Static. Yes, a lot of words, but it's pretty simple. If you put a box with Absolute positioning within a series of other boxes-in-boxes, the Absolute box will align to the first box that has non-Static (non-default) positioning. Easy! 2) Setting positioning to Absolute removes the element from the normal document flow. Thus it can now overlap other elements, which can be good or bad depending on your goal. If you want your element to remain within the box it's currently in, you must set a width and heigh of the container or risk having the Absolute element overrun the borders. It's like the drawer I have for all my t-shirts. The drawer is way too small for all my shirts. If I set my drawer to Relative and my bundle of shirts to Absolute, the shirts would magically spill through the drawer's wall if I didn't also set the drawer's length and height to accommodate the larger bundle. </li>
        <li class="li"><span class="bold">Absolute:</span> here's a tip when thinking about Relative positioning: imagine you have a box. If you set the box's position to Relative, it puts it exactly where it should be (a'la Static positioning). BUT, you can then shift the element Relative to where it would normally land. Repeat: 'relative to where IT should be. It's almost like youre looking at a box and shifting a ghost of itself in one direction, but the original box remains behind. The reason we look at it like this is because of the implications how it has on the normal document flow and any other objects around it. I'm still not exactly clear on how it affects them, but just keep this in mind. For example, if you have a container div that won't collapse to fit the size of the text within, it might be because of this. I'll check back when I learn more!</li>

          <ul><li> What are the benefits of version control?</ul>
              Imagine working in a Word document. When you're ready to store changes you click "Save" (Git calls this "commit"). But what happens if you want to return to a prior savepoint? This feature is  typically unavailable for consumer programs, and this is where version control shines. When you're ready to "save" a file in Git, you "commit" the changes. It's akin to saving multiple copies of the same file at each milestone. Furthermore, Git's version control tracks helpful info like what changes were made and memos from the change'ee.
          <p>
          <ul><li>How does git help you keep track of changes?</ul>
               Life isn't a video game (so it seems). Consequentially we benefit from ways to cover our tracks should we fall into the proverbial crocodile-pit (for example a faulty line of code). Keeping track of changes is a way to create save points. Furthermore, this makes things easier for us to collaborate with others, and that means more changes to create awesome code! By tracking changes, new collaborators also get a better understanding of the history of our code, what each version does, etc,
          </p>
          <p>
              <ul><li>Why use GitHub to store your code?</ul>
              GitHub's value is expansive. It's a place to store and track code. It's a place to show of and find other people's code. It's a place to get help and help other people's code. Furthermore, GitHub's format is conducive for companies with multiple people working on the same data set. And all of this is done in an approachable GUI format. It's a valuable resource whether you're a hobbyist working on your first "Hello World", or a team of a hundred developers working on a website.

        C1 Chef's Kicthen: DBC Refleciton. AKA: <span class="italics">Development Isn't a Spectator Sport"</span> 4.11.15
        </p>
        <p class="blogpost">
         <section>
        <p>
          Today we watched <span class="link"><a href = https://vimeo.com/85001014> a fireside chat recording with Shereef - DBC founder</a></span>. As always, Shefeef's enthusiasm for building a strong, healthy and passionate coding environment is infectious. He describes the fist cohort, being a marauding group of youthful coders rallied via Hacker News. Something he recognized was their ability to work as a team. Something in the office is broken? Take the lead and fix it. People are hungry? Order food. It was a group of do'ers, and do they did. Shereef goes on to describe how important this mentality is with DBC and with learning any new skill. Treat DBC as if you're a cook in a kitchen, as if you're one of many on a soccer team. If something needs to get done, do it. If someone is struggling, help them. If you aren't understanding something, go out there and try to undestand it. Don't look at your education as something you purchase. It's not a package, it's not a service. It's an interactive experience, and your role isn't to just watch. Showing up doesn't mean showing up physically. It means showing up emotionally, intelligently, empathetically.
        </p>
        <p>
            So far my take on the DBC expericence is better than I expected. Well, I suppose it's been all I was hoping for, and that's something I don't take for granted. The curriculum isn't too easy, and it isn't too hard. I trust I'll eat my words in a few weeks and consider these early weeks to have been cakewalk. But the introduction has been a nice pace. I can tell a lot of work went into our syllabus. I like the repetion, the immersion, the teaching-by-doing. In the past I've tried to learn CLI and Git. I'm finding that it's finally just now sticking, and that's exciting. 
        </p>
        <p>
           I'm also really enjoying how active my 'cohorts' have been on Google+. People don't seem to be afraid to reach out and to help out. I've felt comfortable seeking help as well. A few times I began asking something that was stumping me, but I decided to try just one more time before "bugging" other people's inboxes. I know I shouldn't look at it like that. And I don't really. But I think it's encouraging to know people are there to help, but in the end, this is my education, my playground. I need to struggle, to know when to keep looking, and to know when to ask for help. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My end-of-week reflection is that I'm liking how things are going. I think I fall in the "imposter" category and need to keep that in mind. That said, I'm finding myself stepping up to the plate. And what's exciting to me is that I'm finding myself overcoming little bugs, issues, mis-steps. Instead of moving on and skipping over something if it's not working or doesn't make sense, I'm finding myself really curious to fix it/understand it before moving on. That said, I need to be cognisant of the time. I hear it's only going to get more rigorous going forward. I'd like to be done with my work by Friday evening, saving bonus work for the weekend. This means time management, and this means mind-management. I'm working on getting into my zone quicker. On the flip side, I'm working on being ok with working out of my zone. That say I can take advantage of the quick 30-minute window before dinner is ready, for example.
